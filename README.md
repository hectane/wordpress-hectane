## go-cannon WordPress Plugin

This plugin provides an extremely easy way to route WordPress emails through [go-cannon](https://github.com/nathan-osman/go-cannon). After installing and configuring the plugin, all calls to `wp_mail()` will be intercepted and sent to go-cannon which will take care of delivery.
